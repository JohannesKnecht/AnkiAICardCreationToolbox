{"data": "Text Files\nAny plain text file that contains fields separated by commas, semicolons or tabs can be imported into Anki, provided some conditions are met.\n-\nThe files must be plain text (myfile.txt). Other formats like myfile.xls, myfile.rtf, myfile.doc must be saved as a plain text file first.\n-\nThe files must be in UTF-8 format (see below).\n-\nAnki determines the number of fields in the file by looking at the first (non-commented) line. If some of the later records in the file contain fewer fields, Anki will treat the missing fields as if they were blank. If some of your records contain extra fields, the extra content will not be imported.\n-\nAnki tries to guess which field separator (commas, tabs, etc.) your file uses. If it guesses wrongly, you can change it in the import options window and preview the results. Or you can add file headers to force a specific field separator.\nFields in your text file can be mapped to any field in your notes, including the tags field. You can choose which field in the text file corresponds to which field in the note when you import.\nWhen you import a text file, you can choose what deck to put the cards in. Keep in mind that if you have the deck override option set for one or more of your templates, the cards will go to that deck rather than the one you\u2019ve selected.\nThis is an example of a valid file with three fields:\napple;banana;grape\nfirst field;second field;third field\nThere are two ways to include newlines or the field separator in fields.\nEscape the characters by placing the contents of the field in quotation marks:\nhello;\"this is\na two line answer\"\ntwo;this is a one line field\n\"this includes a ; (semicolon)\";another field\nBecause quotes are used to mark where a field begins and ends, if you wish to include them inside your field, you need to replace a single doublequote with two doublequotes to \u201cescape\u201d them from the regular handling, like so:\nfield one;\"field two with \"\"escaped quotes\"\" inside it\"\nWhen you use a spreadsheet program like Libreoffice to create the CSV file for you, it will automatically take care of escaping double quotes.\nUse HTML new lines:\nhello; this is<br>a two line answer\ntwo; this is a one line one\nYou need to turn on the Allow HTML in fields in the import dialog for HTML newlines to work.\nEscaped multi-lines will not work correctly if you are using cloze deletions that span multiple lines. In this case, please use HTML newlines instead.\nYou can also include tags in another field and select it as a tags field in the import dialog:\nfirst field;second field;tags\nThis is an example of a valid file where the first line is ignored (#):\n# this is a comment and is ignored\nfoo bar;bar baz;baz quux\nfield1;field2;field3\nSpreadsheets and UTF-8\nIf you have non-Latin characters in your file (such as accents, Japanese and so on), Anki expects files to be saved in a \u201cUTF-8 encoding\u201d. The easiest way to do this is to use the free LibreOffice spreadsheet program instead of Excel to edit your file, as it supports UTF-8 easily, and also exports multi-line content properly, unlike Excel. If you wish to keep using Excel, please see this doc for more information.\nTo save your spreadsheet to a file Anki can read with LibreOffice, go to File > Save As, and then select CSV for the type of file. After accepting the default options, LibreOffice will save the file and you can then import the saved file into Anki.\nHTML\nAnki can treat text imported from text files as HTML (the language used for web pages). This means that text with bold, italics and other formatting can be exported to a text file and imported again. If you want to include HTML formatting, you can check the \u201callow HTML in fields\u201d checkbox when importing. You may wish to turn this off if you\u2019re trying to import cards whose content contains angle brackets or other HTML syntax.\nIf you wish to use HTML for formatting your file but also wish to include angle brackets or ampersands, you may use the following replacements:\n| Character | Replacement |\n|---|---|\n| < | < |\n| > | > |\n| & | & |\nImporting Media\nIf you want to include audio and pictures from a text file import, copy the files into the collection.media folder. Do not put subdirectories in the media folder, or some features will not work.\nAfter you\u2019ve copied the files, change one of the fields in your text file as follows.\n<img src=\"myimage.jpg\">\nor\n[sound:myaudio.mp3]\nAlternatively, you can use the find and replace feature in the browse screen to update all the fields at once. If each field contains text like \u201cmyaudio\u201d, and you wish to make it play a sound, you\u2019d search for (.*) and replace it with \u201c[sound:\\1.mp3]\u201d, with the regular expressions option enabled.\nWhen importing a text file with these references, you must make sure to enable the \u201cAllow HTML\u201d option.\nYou might be tempted to do this in a template, like:\n<img src=\"{{field name}}\">\nAnki doesn\u2019t support this for two reasons: searching for used media is expensive, as each card has to be rendered, and such functionality isn\u2019t obvious to shared deck users. Please use the find & replace technique instead.\nBulk Media\nAnother option for importing large amounts of media at once is to use the media import add-on. This add-on will automatically create notes for all files in a folder you select, with the filenames on the front (minus the file extension, so if you have a file named apple.jpg, the front would say \u201capple\u201d) and the images or audio on the back. If you would like a different arrangement of media and filenames, you can change the note type of the created cards afterwards.\nDuplicates and Updating\nWhen importing text files, Anki uses the first field to determine if a note is unique. By default, if the file you are importing has a first field that matches one of the existing notes in your collection and that existing note is the same type as the type you\u2019re importing, the existing note\u2019s other fields will be updated based on content of the imported file. A drop-down box in the import screen allows you to change this behaviour, to either ignore duplicates completely, or import them as new notes instead of updating existing ones.\nThe match scope setting controls how duplicates are identified. When note type is selected, Anki will identify a duplicate if another note with the same note type has the same first field. When set to note type and deck, a duplicate will only be flagged if the existing note also happens to be in the deck you are importing into.\nIf you have updating turned on and older versions of the notes you\u2019re importing are already in your collection, they will be updated in place (in their current decks) rather than being moved to the deck you have set in the import dialog. If notes are updated in place, the existing scheduling information on all their cards will be preserved.\nFor info on how duplicates are handled in .apkg files, please see the Deck Packages section.\nFile Headers\nAnki 2.1.54+ supports certain headers that can be included in the text file to\nmake importing more powerful or convenient. They consist of #key:value\npairs\nand must be listed in separate lines at the top of the file.\n| Key | Allowed Values | Behaviour |\n|---|---|---|\nseparator | Comma , Semicolon , Tab , Space , Pipe , Colon , or the corresponding literal characters | Determines the field separator. |\nhtml | true , false | Determines whether the file is treated as HTML. |\ntags | List of tags, separated by spaces | Adds the listed tags to every imported note. |\ncolumns | List of names, separated by the previously set separator | Determines the number of columns and shows their given names when importing. |\nnotetype | Note type name or id | Presets the note type, if it exists. |\ndeck | Deck name or id | Presets the deck, if it exists. |\nnotetype column | 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 | Determines which column contains the note type name or id of each note, see Notetype Column. |\ndeck column | 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 | Determines which column contains the deck name or id of each note, see Deck Column. |\ntags column | 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 | Determines which column contains the tags of each note. |\nguid column | 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 | Determines which column contains the GUID of each note, see GUID Column. |\nSome headers have further implications.\nNotetype Column\nUsually, all notes from a file will be mapped to a single note type. That changes, if there is a column with note type names or ids.\nThis allows you to import notes with different note types, and their fields will be mapped implicitly: The first regular column is used for the first field of any note regardless of its note type, the second regular column for the second field, and so on. A regular column here being a column that does not contain special information like decks, tags, note types or GUIDs.\nDeck Column\nUsually, any new cards created as a result of importing a text file will be placed in a single deck of your choice. If the file contains a deck column, however, new cards of a note will be placed in its specified deck instead. If the deck does not exist, a deck with the given name will be created.\nGUID Column\nGUID stands for Globally Unique Identifier. When you create notes in Anki, Anki assigns each note a unique ID, which can be used for duplicate checking. If you export your notes with the GUID included, you can make changes to the notes, and as long as you do not modify the GUID field, you\u2019ll be able to import the notes back in to update the existing notes.\nPlease note that the GUID is intended to be created by Anki. If you are creating\nyour own IDs, such as MYNOTE0001\n, then it\u2019s recommended that you place the IDs\nin the first field, instead of assigning them to Anki\u2019s internal GUID. When importing,\nAnki is able to use either the first field or the GUID for duplicate checking, so you do not\nneed to make IDs a GUID in order to be able to update your notes.\nOne other thing to note is that the duplicate option will not work for rows that have a non-empty GUID. If a GUID is provided, and already exists in the collection, a duplicate will not be created."}
